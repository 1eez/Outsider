"Congratulations to everyone for successfully completing the challenge. The first person to exit, Mo Yu, is the MVP of this session. We have prepared a special gift for you, please follow me."

Little A led Mo Yu to another room and sat at the head of a long table, with a serious expression as if transformed into a different person. "Come, tell me."

"As the close observer of this escape room, my task was to differentiate the four challengers and determine which group they belong to: the intellectuals, the adventurers, the cyborgs, or the primordials." Mo Yu took a seat, seemingly oblivious to the screens of various sizes scattered across the walls, playing the recent experiences of the escape room from different angles, in detail and comprehensively.

"The easiest to determine is Wuhen. He is a genius, belonging to the 'intellectuals' group that pursues higher wisdom. With the added bonus of the Fast Pass award, he clearly let loose today, effortlessly solving every puzzle with his sharp intellect. If it weren't for Lin Yiyi insisting on teamwork, he probably wouldn't have bothered explaining anything to us." Mo Yu confidently stated.

"Oh? Perhaps he is simply a highly intelligent primordial being?" Little A asked.

"Let me confirm that Wuhen is an intellectual through the question about carbon sixty. It may not be difficult to deduce carbon sixty through soccer and the surrounding environment, but only an intellectual with intelligence and knowledge far surpassing a primordial being can spontaneously state the molecular weight of carbon sixty." Mo Yu shrugged and continued, "Furthermore, Wuhen always avoided any challenges requiring physical strength or risk, which contradicts the knightly spirit and gentlemanly demeanor advocated by male primordial beings. The phenomenon of inferior physical fitness due to the choice made at birth is also common among intellectuals."

"What about the others?" Little A inquired.

"Tiantian is simply the reincarnation of the battle angel Alita. Her performance on the Ferris wheel and carousel demonstrates that she undoubtedly belongs to the 'adventurers' group, pursuing physical breakthroughs. Her movements are simple, decisive, and swift, making her progress through the challenges a visual delight. It's silky smooth and flawless!" Mo Yu praised with overflowing enthusiasm.

"Enough about her, tell me about the others." Little A continued.

"Sinan is a bit difficult to determine. He is understated and gentle, always considerate of everyone's feelings. Everyone naturally trusts and likes him. He is especially protective of Lin Yiyi. Although his professional qualities as a psychologist make him naturally suitable as a boyfriend, he is also... too perfect." Mo Yu fell into thought, paused, and continued.

"So far, his performance could also indicate him being a high-quality primordial being. What made me doubt his identity was at the art gallery. The moment he heard the survivor clearance notification sound, an ordinary person would typically be happy, but his emotions were particularly low, filled with self-blame. Although we later deduced that it was a false ending, his reaction at that moment spoke for itself." Mo Yu rubbed his neck.

"Of course, this is only suspicion. What ultimately convinced me was the Bride of the Ghost's encounter. Apart from cyborgs, no other group can instantaneously change their appearance, voice, and behavioral patterns. Even experienced actors cannot completely transform into someone else in an instant."

"To sum up, by surrendering oneself, protecting humanity, and possessing the ability to change appearances instantaneously, acting according to human commands, Sinan is a cyborg who strictly adheres to the three laws of robotics. I believe that you gave him two different instructions during the Matryoshka escape room." Mo Yu smiled bitterly.

"Well done, observer. Wise analysis and judgment. What about Lin Yiyi?" Little A asked.

"Lin Yiyi's performance throughout was ordinary. Her mind and body have not undergone any modifications or upgrades, being a primordial being with the most traditional thoughts." Mo Yu's tone became calm.

"But I have always admired primordial beings. They firmly believe that pure humans are the true humans, persisting in treating everything with their original, natural instincts. This may seem ordinary, even clumsy. Perhaps it is precisely because of this primal and natural aspect that primordial beings' love becomes the purest, deepest, and most sacred existence. This love surpasses all other emotions, abilities, concepts, and personalities. The power of true love prompted Lin Yiyi to make the right choice in the final challenge, embracing the Bride of the Ghost with selflessness and overflowing affection."

"At the same time, I also observed that making a group choice at birth can bring some troubles..." Mo Yu wanted to continue speaking, but Little A decisively interrupted him. "Congratulations, Mo Yu, you have completed your task. The experiment is over."

With Little A's command, the long table, screen walls, waiting room, and even Mo Yu vanished without a trace.
