{{< /lead >}}

The graduate student Lin Yiyi from the Medical University and the fitness coach Yue Tiantian are close friends with contrasting personalities. Lin Yiyi's boyfriend, Si Nan, is a caring psychological counselor. The three of them met the highly intelligent prodigy Wuhen and the investigative journalist Moyu while playing an escape room game. Sharing common interests, the five of them formed a stable group in the escape room.

One day, they made an appointment to challenge the infamous "Outsider," known for its terrifying ceiling. With its intricate and demanding rules, illusory scenes, and hidden secrets within the light, how will they unravel the fog and uncover the truth?

After successfully passing through the room by utilizing their respective strengths, they discovered that the room's enigmatic nature did not stem from external sound and light effects, but rather from the hidden fears within each person's heart. Can they still rely on their companions? How many intricate calculations lie behind their backs? Is human nature inherently good or evil?

The answer awaits your revelation...
