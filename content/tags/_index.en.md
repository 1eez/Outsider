Tags are a means of affixing labels to articles, allowing readers to swiftly grasp the theme or content of the text.

In websites and blogs, it is customary to assign one or more tags to each article.

Tags can consist of single words or phrases, encompassing the pivotal keywords or subjects of the article.

When readers browse websites or search for specific topics, they can locate relevant articles by clicking on pertinent tags.

The utilization of tags not only aids in organizing and categorizing articles, but also facilitates readers in perusing and filtering texts based on their own interests and requirements.

Therefore, tags serve as a crucial tool that enhances the reading experience and efficiency of information retrieval.
